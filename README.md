# Boxoffice and Collaboration
## An analysis of human factors in Hollywood  

This project consists of three parts:  
1. Scraping data from [BoxOffice Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/).     
2. Features are engineered from the data.   
3. Use OLS, Lasso, and RandomForest Regressor to find the best model.    
    
Presentation slides and jupyter notebooks are included in this repo, as well as  code for parts 1&2 and intermediate data.
